So that's me: trying a tutorial, because
_being tutored_ is so much more relaxing
than being a **tutor**. No for nesting:
*italic **bold** back* and **bold _italic_ text**.

Trickier: ***bolditalic* text** vs ***italicbold** text*

What I entered: `***bolditalic* text* vs ***italicbold** text*`

At least the hiliting in my editor is confused now...
